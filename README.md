# CMPM-121-G33-Final

<!-- FIXME: Flesh out these answers with better explanation -->

## Introducing the team

- Marvel McDowell - Design Lead
- Jonathan D Cheng - Tools Lead/Design Lead
- Brian Chung - Tools Lead
- Jalen Suwa - Tools/Engine Lead
- Dylan Boyer - Engine Lead

## Tools and materials

__Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.__

-  We will be starting out with using just Javascript/HTML/CSS in the DOM because it is what we are all generally familiar with.

__Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably youâ€™ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.__

- We will be using Typescript for our Javascript/ECMAScript parts because it helps ensure better code quality. JSON will likely be used for any data storage due to its ease of use with Javascript code.

__Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.__

- We will be using Git for version control and VS Studio + VS Code for scripting.

__Tell us about your alternate platform choice. Remember, your alternate platform must differ from your primary platform by either changing the primary primarily language used or the engine/library/framework used for building your user interface.__

- We will plan to transfer to another JS framework to minimize the amount of porting that needs to be done.

## Outlook

We hope to gain the ability to be flexible with onboarding onto new game engines while working within a team.
