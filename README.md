- Dylan Boyer - Engine Lead / Design Backup

## Tools and materials

__Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.__

-  We will be starting out with using just Javascript/HTML/CSS in the DOM because it is what we are all generally familiar with. Additionally, we are using Deno for runtime and Vite for building and bundling the project due to their modern features and ease of use.

__Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably youâ€™ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.__

- We will be using Typescript for our Javascript/ECMAScript parts because it helps ensure better code quality. JSON will likely be used for any data storage due to its ease of use with Javascript code.

__Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.__

- We will be using Git for version control and VS Studio + VS Code for scripting. We are also using Deno for its modern runtime capabilities and Vite for its fast build and development server.

__Tell us about your alternate platform choice. Remember, your alternate platform must differ from your primary platform by either changing the primary primarily language used or the engine/library/framework used for building your user interface.__

- We will plan to transfer to another JS framework like React or Vue to minimize the amount of porting that needs to be done while still leveraging the benefits of a modern framework.

## Outlook

We hope to gain the ability to be flexible with onboarding onto new game engines while working within a team. Our team is aiming to create a highly interactive and visually appealing game that leverages modern web technologies like Deno and Vite for optimal performance and development speed. We anticipate that the hardest part of the project will be ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay within the constraints of the browser environment, especially as the complexity of the game increases. By using TypeScript and modern build tools, we hope to learn more about maintaining code quality and efficiency in a collaborative setting, as well as gaining deeper insights into the capabilities of these technologies for future projects.
