# CMPM-121-G33-Final

## Introducing the team

- Marvel McDowell - Design Lead
- Jonathan D Cheng - Tools Lead/Design Lead
- Brian Chung - Tools Lead
- Jalen Suwa - Tools/Engine Lead
- Dylan Boyer - Engine Lead





## Tools and materials
__Tell us about what engines, libraries, frameworks, and or platforms you intend to use, and give us a tiny bit of detail about why your team chose those.__
- We will be using Git for verision control, Unity+C#. Then we'll swap to Unreal Engine. We'll most likely be using Blender for 3D modeling and VS Studio + VS Code for scripting.

Tell us programming languages (e.g. TypeScript) and data languages (e.g. JSON) you team expects to use and why you chose them. Presumably youâ€™ll just be using the languages expected by your previously chosen engine/platform.

Tell us about which tools you expect to use in the process of authoring your project. You might name the IDE for writing code, the image editor for creating visual assets, or the 3D editor you will use for building your scene. Again, briefly tell us why you made these choices. Maybe one of your teammates feels especially skilled in that tool or it represents something you all want to learn about.

Tell us about your alternate platform choice. Remember, your alternate platform must differ from your primary platform by either changing the primary primarily language used or the engine/library/framework used for building your user interface.


## Outlook
We hope to gain the abality to be flexable with onboarding onto new game engines while working within a team.
